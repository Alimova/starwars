		A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
		It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden 
		base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. 
		During the battle, Rebel spies managed 
		to steal secret plans to the Empire's 
		ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an 
		armored space station with enough 
		power to destroy an entire planet. 
		Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, 
		Princess Leia races home aboard her 
		starship, custodian of the stolen plans 
		that can save her people and restore 
		freedom to the galaxy....
